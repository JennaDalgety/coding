# Martin is writing his opus: a book of algorithm
# challenges, set as lyrics to a suite of baroque
# fugues. He knows that some of those fugueing
# challenges will be less popular than others, so he
# needs a book index. Given a sorted array of
# pages, produce a book index string. Consecutive
# pages should form ranges separated by a dash.
# For [1,3,4,5,7,8,10], return the string "1,
# 3-5, 7-8, 10".

1. create a function that takes a list of numbers
2. function should for loop through the list of numbers
3. function should evaluate if there are consecutive numbers
   - function should insert 
4. if there are consecutive numbers, the function should take the first and last number in the range
5. the function should insert a hyphen in between the first and last number in the range
6. function should return the new list as a string
